# My Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my porfolio! This was made to display some of my recent work and projects for future employers to review. This webpage was built to change and I'm looking forward to adding more updates as I grow as a developer.

## Usage

My porfolio can be viewed at [https://elliewalsch.github.io/portfolio/](https://elliewalsch.github.io/portfolio/). Users can use multiple devices or check out the developer tools to observe how the webpage changes at different screen sizes.
